* About
This repository is mirror of rogue 5.4.4.
I got source from [[https://web.archive.org/web/20160604014248/http://rogue.rogueforge.net:80/][Web Archive]] and modified a bit.
* Compile and install
Just
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./configure
make
(sudo) make install
#+END_SRC
* What changed from Original
- modified compile error because of the change in term.h(struct term aka 'TERMINAL' is now hidden unless NCURSES_INTERNALS is declared).
- You can use an environment variable to set user name. Like,
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
env ROGUEUSER='pochi' rogue
#+END_SRC
